Version 3.1.0
-------------

+ **New Features**
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * Implement a general memory caching object. Currently, this will be used
     by the Posix object.
   * Allow optional memory caching when using the Posix library. This is
     primarily used by the proxy object to reduce trips to a data server when
     small blocks are accessed via the proxy server. This requires
     configuration using the new 'pss.memcache' directive.
   * Finally implement adding authentication information to the user monitoring
     record (requested by Matevz Tadel, CMS). This adds a new generic option,
     auth, to the xrootd.monitor directive. It needs to be specified for the
     authentication information to be added. This keeps backward compatability.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Fix incorrect lock handling for multiple waiters.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Report correct port when locate is directly issued to a data server
     (before it was being reported as 0).
   * Make the default file system a pointer to a dynamic instance of XrdOfs
     instead of a global static (i.e. the Andreas Peters patch). This makes
     writing an ofs plugin easier.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Rename XrdNetDNS to XrdSysDNS to avoid cross-dependencies. This means that all
     plug-in developers will need to do the same as XrdNetDNS no longer exists.
   * Split XrdFrm into XrdFrm and XrdFrc. This prevents cross-dependencies in
     packages that use the File Residency Manager.
