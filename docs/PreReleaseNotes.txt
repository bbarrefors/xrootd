Prerelease Notes
================
+ **New Features**
   * Create a general place for platform dependent utility methods.
   * Add third party copy statistics to the summary record.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Prevent SEGV when xrd.monitor rbuff value not specified.
   * Correct test whether or not to initialize redirect monitoring. The old
     code never initialized it this disabling redirect monitoring. 
   * Prevent double-free abort when more than 16 files have been opened by a
     client and the client terminates the session without closing the 17th one.
   * Undo the side-effect of commit ff8bdbd6 that prevented the frm from
     sending stage notifications to xrootd; causing opens and xrdstagetool
     to hang with dynamic staging enabled.
   * Make sure the id buffer is large enough to hold all id combinations.
   * Avoid deadlock when closing a Posix File with an active preread.
   * For concurrent queries for the same file allow servers to respond to the
     query and only redirect clients to a stageable server if the file is not found. 

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Prevent hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * Correct log processing for sites that use the root directory as the
     stomping ground for newly created files.
   * Fix the -force option to really work for the mark subcommand.
   * Pass through error code returned by the N2N plug-in. This only affects
     the proxy server and caused feature interference.
   * Automatically exclude originating server/cluster on an enoent static
     redirect.
   * Correct typos XRDPSOIX envars should really be named XRDPOSIX.

+ **Miscellaneous**
